# OpenVisionCPP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/milo-sobral/OpenVisionCPP.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/milo-sobral/OpenVisionCPP)

A repository to play around with C++, Computer Vision, and NVIDIA CUDA.

The goals of this repository are:
* 1. Gain familiarity with the C++ language and all the build tools that exist around.   
* 2. Implement some basic Computer Vision algorithms (Edge detection, blurring, rotation...).
* 3. Add GPU support using CUDA and an Nvidia graphics card to learn how to program with CUDA.
